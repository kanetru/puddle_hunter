# puddle_hunter
Puddle Hunter is an automated water classification of sentinel 2 imagery, used for the creation of water inundation time series maps. These maps are useful for seeing how water interacts with the landscape across seasons, times, tides, and under different management regimes. They can also be used to mask pixels for landscape analysis.
